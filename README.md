# CMP9791 – Cloud Data Platforms and Tools  
## Power BI Winter Service Analysis (Edinburgh)

This repository contains the final submission for the MSc module  
**CMP9791 – Cloud Data Platforms and Tools**.

## Project Overview
An interactive Power BI dashboard analysing winter service provision in the
City of Edinburgh. GeoJSON datasets representing gritting routes and grit bin
locations are transformed and modelled to support proximity-based coverage
assessment.

An independently sourced road traffic collision dataset is included to provide
contextual road safety insight during adverse weather conditions.
